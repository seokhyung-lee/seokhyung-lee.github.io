  abstract = {The coherent-state qubit is a promising candidate for optical quantum information processing due to its nearly deterministic nature of the Bell-state measurement (BSM). However, its nonorthogonality incurs difficulties such as the failure of the BSM. One may use a large amplitude ($$\alpha$$) for the coherent state to minimize the failure probability, but the qubit then becomes more vulnerable to dephasing by photon loss. We propose a hardware-efficient concatenated BSM (CBSM) scheme with modified parity encoding using coherent states with reasonably small amplitudes ($$\alpha \lessapprox 2$$), which simultaneously suppresses both failures and dephasing in the BSM procedure. We numerically show that the CBSM scheme achieves a success probability arbitrarily close to unity for appropriate values of ùõº and sufficiently low photon loss rates (e.g., $$\lessapprox 5\%$$). Furthermore, we verify that the quantum repeater scheme exploiting the CBSM scheme for quantum error correction enables one to carry out efficient long-range quantum communication over 1000 km. We show that the performance is comparable to those of other up-to-date methods and even exceeds them in some cases. Finally, we present methods to prepare logical qubits under modified parity encoding, and we implement elementary logical operations, which consist of several physical-level ingredients such as generation of superpositions of coherent states (SCSs) and elementary gates under the coherent-state basis. We then estimate the effects of imperfect physical-level elements on the performance of the scheme. Our work demonstrates that the encoded coherent-state qubits in free-propagating fields provide an alternative route to fault-tolerant information processing, especially to long-range quantum communication.},

  abstract = {Topological measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) enables one to carry out universal fault-tolerant quantum computation via single-qubit measurements with a family of large entangled states called cluster states as resources. Raussendorf's three-dimensional cluster states (RTCSs) based on the surface codes are mainly considered for topological MBQC. In such schemes, however, the logical Hadamard, phase ($$Z^{1/2}$$), and $$T$$ ($$Z^{1/4}$$) gates which are essential for building up arbitrary logical gates are not implemented natively without using state distillation or lattice dislocations, to the best of our knowledge. In particular, state distillation generally consumes many ancillary logical qubits; thus it is a severe obstacle against practical quantum computing. To solve this problem, we suggest an MBQC scheme via a family of cluster states called color-code-based cluster states (CCCSs) based on the two-dimensional color codes instead of the surface codes. We define logical qubits, construct elementary logical gates, and describe error correction schemes. We show that all logical Clifford gates generated by the cnot, Hadamard, and phase gates can be implemented natively in a fault-tolerant manner, although the $$T$$ gate still requires state distillation to be fault-tolerant. The error thresholds of MBQC via CCCSs for logical-$$Z$$ errors are calculated to be 2.7%‚Äì2.8%, which are comparable to the values for RTCSs, assuming a simple error model where physical qubits have nontrivial errors independently with the same probability. We analyze and compare the resource overheads of both the schemes. In particular, we show that the number of physical qubits required for implementing a phase gate with CCCSs is at least about 26 times smaller than with RTCSs using state distillation, for the same code distance.},

  abstract = {Linear optical quantum computing is beset by the lack of deterministic entangling operations besides photon loss. Motivated by advancements at the experimental front in deterministic generation of various kinds of multiphoton entangled states, we propose an architecture for linear-optical quantum computing that harnesses the availability of three-photon Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states. Our architecture and its subvariants use polarized photons in GHZ states, polarization beam splitters, delay lines, optical switches, and on-off detectors. We concatenate the topological quantum error-correction code with three-qubit repetition codes and estimate that our architecture can tolerate a remarkably high photon-loss rate of 11.5%; this makes a drastic change that is at least an order higher than those of known proposals. Furthermore, considering three-photon GHZ states as resources, we estimate the resource overheads to perform gate operations with an accuracy of $$10^{-6}$$($$10^{-15}$$) to be $$2.07\times 10^6$$ ($$5.03 \times 10^7$$). Compared to other all-photonic schemes, our architecture is also resource efficient. In addition, the resource overhead can be even further improved if larger GHZ states are available. Given its striking enhancement in the photon-loss threshold and the recent progress in generating multiphoton entanglement, our scheme moves scalable photonic quantum computing a step closer to reality.},
