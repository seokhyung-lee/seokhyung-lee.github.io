My paper ["Color code decoder with improved scaling for correcting circuit-level noise"](https://doi.org/10.22331/q-2025-01-27-1609) has been published in Quantum! It introduces a color code decoder that can correct circuit-level noise, achieving better sub-threshold scaling compared to existing matching-based decoders.
