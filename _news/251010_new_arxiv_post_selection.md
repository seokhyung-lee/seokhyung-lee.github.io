My new paper ["Efficient Post-Selection for General Quantum LDPC Codes"](https://scirate.com/arxiv/2510.05795) with Lucas English and Stephen Bartlett is out! We introduce a new post-selection method for QLDPC codes that significantly reduces the logical error rate by orders of magnitude, overcoming the generalizability and efficiency issues of the conventional logical gap method.
