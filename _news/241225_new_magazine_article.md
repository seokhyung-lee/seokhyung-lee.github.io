I wrote an article titled ["색 부호를 활용한 결함허용 양자컴퓨팅 (Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing with the Color Code)"](https://webzine.kps.or.kr/?p=5_view&idx=17024) for the Korean magazine [물리학과 첨단기술 (Physics and High Technology)](https://webzine.kps.or.kr/?p=8). The article provides a brief introduction to fault-tolerant quantum computing using the color code. If you’re interested (and can read Korean), take a look!
