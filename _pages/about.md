My name is **Seok-Hyung Lee** (**이석형** in Korean) and I'm a theoretical physicist working in the fields of **quantum information and computation**.
Specifically, I'm interested in quantum error correction and photonic quantum computing.
I'm currently a postdoctoral associate in the _[Quantum Theory Group](https://quantum.sydney.edu.au)_ at the **[University of Sydney](https://www.google.co.kr/search?q=university+of+sydney)** (Australia), working with Prof. [Stephen D. Bartlett](https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/about/our-people/academic-staff/stephen-bartlett.html) on quantum error correction with color codes.

From 2017 to 2023, I was a PhD student in the _[Center for Macroscopic Quantum Control](http://cmqc.snu.ac.kr)_ at the **[Seoul National University](https://www.snu.ac.kr)** (Republic of Korea), supervised by Prof. [Hyunseok Jeong](https://physics.snu.ac.kr/hjeong/). I mainly studied measurement-based quantum computing in photonic platforms and received my PhD in Physics with a dissertation ["Universal Resource-efficient Topological Measurement-based Quantum Computing"](https://s-space.snu.ac.kr/handle/10371/194330). In 2017, I completed my undergraduate in Physics at the **[Seoul National University](https://www.snu.ac.kr)** (Republic of Korea).
