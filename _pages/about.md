My name is **Seok-Hyung Lee** (**이석형** in Korean), and I am a theoretical physicist specialising in quantum information and computation.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on **resource-efficient, fault-tolerant quantum computing through quantum error correction**, including:
- Decoding algorithms
- Logical operations
- Magic state preparation
- Syndrome extraction
- Code construction
