I am a theoretical physicist specializing in **quantum information and computation**. 
My research primarily focuses on quantum error correction and photonic quantum computing. 
Currently, I am a postdoctoral associate in the _[Quantum Theory Group](https://quantum.sydney.edu.au)_ at the **[University of Sydney](https://www.google.co.kr/search?q=university+of+sydney)** (Australia), working with Prof. [Stephen D. Bartlett](https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/about/our-people/academic-staff/stephen-bartlett.html) on quantum error correction using 2D color codes.
I began this position in Mar 2023.

Previously, from Mar 2017 to Feb 2023, I pursued my PhD at the _[Center for Macroscopic Quantum Control](http://cmqc.snu.ac.kr)_ at **[Seoul National University](https://www.snu.ac.kr)** (Republic of Korea) under the guidance of Prof. [Hyunseok Jeong](https://physics.snu.ac.kr/hjeong/). 
My doctoral research focused on measurement-based quantum computing in photonic platforms, culminating in my dissertation titled ["Universal Resource-efficient Topological Measurement-based Quantum Computing"](https://s-space.snu.ac.kr/handle/10371/194330). 
From Mar 2013 to Feb 2017, I completed my undergraduate studies in Physics at the same university.
