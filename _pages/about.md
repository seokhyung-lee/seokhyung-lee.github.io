My name is **Seok-Hyung Lee** (**이석형** in Korean), and I am a theoretical physicist specialising in quantum information and computation.
My research primarily focuses on developing and optimising **resource-efficient, fault-tolerant quantum computing strategies through quantum error correction**. 
This includes areas such as decoding, logical operations, magic state preparation, syndrome extraction, and code construction. 

Currently, I am an Assistant Professor in the _[Department of Quantum Information Engineering](https://qie.skku.edu/qie/index.do)_ at **[Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU)](https://www.skku.edu/eng/)** in South Korea, where I began in Sep 2025.

Previously, from Mar 2023 to Sep 2025, I was a postdoc in the _[Quantum Theory Group](https://quantum.sydney.edu.au/research/quantum-theory-group)_ at the **[University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au)** in Australia, working with Prof. [Stephen D. Bartlett](https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/about/our-people/academic-staff/stephen-bartlett.html) on quantum error correction using 2D color codes.

From Mar 2017 to Feb 2023, I pursued my PhD at the _[Center for Macroscopic Quantum Control](http://cmqc.snu.ac.kr)_ at **[Seoul National University](https://www.snu.ac.kr)** in South Korea, under the guidance of Prof. [Hyunseok Jeong](https://physics.snu.ac.kr/hjeong/). 
My doctoral research focused on measurement-based quantum computing in photonic platforms, culminating in my dissertation titled ["Universal Resource-efficient Topological Measurement-based Quantum Computing"](https://s-space.snu.ac.kr/handle/10371/194330). 
From Mar 2013 to Feb 2017, I completed my undergraduate studies in Physics at the same university.
