My name is Seok-Hyung Lee (이석형 in Korean) and I'm a theoretical physicist specializing in quantum information and computation, with a focus on quantum error correction. I'm currently a postdoctoral associate in the <a href='https://quantum.sydney.edu.au'>Quantum Theory Group</a> at the <a href="https://www.google.co.kr/search?q=university+of+sydney">University of Sydney</a>, working with Prof. <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/about/our-people/academic-staff/stephen-bartlett.html">Stephen D. Bartlett</a> on quantum error correction with color codes.
